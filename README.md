The data gathered for this visual of the New York Citi Bike program is from 1/3/2021.
Starting with the Map, displays the stations in each county with the average trip duration and the count of user visits.
This map gives a clear visual of what area is most popular with stations and users.

On the next slide shows the usertype variance. This shows how many subscribers versus customers, the gender in each usertype, and birth year of usertypes.
One thing to notice is the unusual spike in customer usertypes born between 1968 and 1970.

Lastly, the popularity and average trip duration of each start station.
This plot shows that stations with the longer average trip duration are not as popular as stations with a short to medium duration.
